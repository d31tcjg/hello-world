Hello everyone,


My name is Cesar Garcia, and I currently work for CVS Health as a software engineer, primarily focusing on QA automation using C# and SQL. Like Charlie, I am a Huge Dallas Cowboys Fan, born and raised in Texas; what else would you expect? My experience bridging the gap between technical and leadership roles is a unique aspect of my background. In the next few years, I aspire to transition into a management position where I can lead my own team of engineers.
